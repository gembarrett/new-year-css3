New Years Eve CSS3 experiment
=============

Experiment in CSS3 animation

This 12-hour experiment in CSS3 animation demonstrates the use of CSS3 keyframes (fireworks), sprites (background image), and other transition styles. 

- index.html: where the animation takes place
- css: contains folders for the SASS and final, minified stylesheet
- Gruntfile.js: contains the configuration used to make Grunt watch, process and minify the CSS and images
- images: contains the background sprite and social link logos
- package.json: further configuration of the Grunt tasks

Any bug submissions or suggestions for improvements or  features (I'd like to add snow to the animation at some point) gratefully received.
